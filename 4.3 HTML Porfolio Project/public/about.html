<h1>About Me – Enya Elvis</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Enya Elvis, a passionate full-stack web developer from Cross River State, Nigeria. I love being indoors, working on tech projects, and turning creative ideas into real-world solutions. I specialize in backend technologies like PHP, MySQL, Git, and Bash scripting, and I’ve also got solid frontend experience using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Material-UI.</p>

<p>I’m currently enrolled in the ALX Backend Engineering program, and I’ll be completing the 13-week Professional Foundations phase this week. The journey so far has sharpened my skills, broadened my thinking, and strengthened my commitment to excellence in tech.</p>

<p>I’ve built everything from Telegram bots and corporate company websites to blogs and fintech tools, always with a professional, user-focused approach. I’m currently building BELFX, a fintech platform that simplifies P2P transactions in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Aside from coding, I’m big on personal growth and helping others. I’m actively raising awareness about the dangers of early and unplanned pregnancy in my state, and I’m also working on a project to make monthly clearance for NYSC corps members easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>I’m the founder of Complete 24 Vibes and Prompt Bank — platforms where I share value-packed content and help connect Nigerian youths with opportunities, ideas, and stories that matter.</p>

<p>People know me for my honesty, loyalty, and dedication to my craft. Whether it's web development, blogging, training, or just vibing with good food indoors, I'm always giving it my best.</p>

<p>Let’s build something great together.</p>
